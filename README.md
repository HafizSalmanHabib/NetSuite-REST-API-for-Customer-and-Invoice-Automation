### Summary

The provided code is a NetSuite Restlet script designed to handle a POST request. The script primarily deals with creating or updating customer records and processing invoices in the NetSuite system. Here's a detailed summary of the code's functionality:

1. **Initialization and Dependencies**: The script imports necessary NetSuite modules such as `record`, `log`, `error`, `search`, `email`, and `runtime`.

2. **Main Function - `post`**:
   - **Request Handling**: Logs the incoming request body and extracts the order ID.
   - **Order Search**: Checks if the order already exists in NetSuite.
   - **Customer and Distributor Handling**:
     - Searches for the distributor in NetSuite.
     - If the distributor exists, it proceeds to handle the customer.
     - Searches for the customer under the distributor.
     - If the customer exists, it checks for their address.
     - If the address does not exist, it updates the customer's address and creates an invoice.
     - If the customer does not exist, it creates a new customer under the distributor and then creates an invoice.
     - If the distributor does not exist, it sends an email notification.
   - **Error Handling**: Logs and returns errors if any issues occur during the process.

3. **Helper Functions**:
   - `checkSubCustomerExists`: Checks if a sub-customer exists under a given parent customer in NetSuite.

### Business Process

The script automates the process of handling orders received from an external system by performing the following steps:

1. **Order Verification**: Checks if the order already exists in NetSuite to prevent duplicate entries.
2. **Customer and Distributor Management**:
   - **Distributor Verification**: Ensures the distributor exists in NetSuite.
   - **Customer Verification**: Ensures the customer exists under the distributor.
   - **Address Verification**: Ensures the customer's address is up-to-date.
3. **Record Creation**:
   - Creates or updates customer records as needed.
   - Creates an invoice for the order.
   - Processes a customer payment for the invoice.
4. **Error Notification**: Sends email notifications if any part of the process fails due to missing or incorrect data.

This automated handling of orders, customers, and invoices streamlines the business process, reduces manual data entry, and minimizes errors, ensuring accurate and timely record-keeping in NetSuite.
